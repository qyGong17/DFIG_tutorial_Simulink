This is my MATLAB/Simulink simulation models of doubly-fed induction generator control, built following the Youtube tutorial by Dr. Gonzalo Abad, with a few modifications. Many thanks to Dr. Gonzalo Abad for creating this great tutorial series. 

Sorry that some comments are in Chinese. 

In the MathCAD files (*.xmcd), I tried to derive the dynamic models of DFIG. 

- MATLAB/Simulink Version: R2022b
